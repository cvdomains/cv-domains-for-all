# .cv Identity Layer -  cv-domains-for-all

The open, AI-ready identity protocol for work.

## Introduction

The future of talent is shifting. People will no longer be headhunted or apply in the traditional sense. Instead, they will be AI hunted. Voice interfaces, agents, and answer engines will discover, evaluate, and match humans to opportunities at scale.

To support that world, we need a simple, universal, verifiable identity anchor for every person.

**.cv provides that anchor.**

## .cv is Free for Everyone

All **firstnamelastname.cv** domains are free to claim. Anyone can secure their identity in seconds and use it as a central, portable professional link across the internet.
You can go to http://hello.cv/ and claim one

---

## For Platforms

Platforms can integrate with .cv and serve as data hosts. Approved partners can issue up to **one million free firstnamelastname.cv** domains to their users.

**Partners must:**

- Validate real users  
- Enforce the firstnamelastname.cv format  
- Prevent duplicates  
- Maintain quality, accuracy, and liveness checks

## Why This Matters

Voice AI and multimodal AI are changing how profiles are submitted and consumed. Millions of queries will be delivered through conversational flows, voice prompts, and AI generated summaries. Every user needs a simple and permanent link that AI systems can reliably access.

PDFs freeze identity and scatter data across countless platforms. **.cv standardizes identity while keeping it decentralized.** Your domain points to your data, but the data remains yours. You choose exactly what the world can see.

AI traffic has already surpassed human traffic. A universal identity link is the only stable anchor that works for both humans and AI.

## Pricing Model

Partners can provide domains to users for free for the first year.  
After that, renewal for firstnamelastname.cv costs **$7.50 per year** for the partner.

This fee helps support infrastructure, ecosystem growth, and trust and safety operations.

Partners may charge additional fees for services or hosting.  
Names are provided on an as-is basis.

## Best Practices for Partners

- Validate every user  
- Provide a public JSON endpoint at **yourname.cv/json**  
- Expose structured fields for work history, skills, credentials, and more in **JSON-LD**  
- Support optional private data behind access requests  
- Only publish information intended to be public  

---

## Best Practices for AI Bots Accessing .cv

- Start with the `/json` endpoint for structured data  
- Respect hidden or private fields  
- Cache responsibly  
- Avoid scraping and use official endpoints  

---

## Trust and Safety

To maintain the integrity of .cv:

- Partners must verify identity  
- Abuse detection systems are required  
- Regular partner audits  
- Renewal fees help prevent spam, misuse, and namespace abuse  

---

## Roadmap

- Open source SDKs for profile, resume, and CV generation  
- Open credential verification software
